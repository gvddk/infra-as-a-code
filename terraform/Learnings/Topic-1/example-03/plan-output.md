# Terraform plan output

% terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # azurerm_resource_group.example will be created
  + resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + location = "westeurope"
      + name     = "example-resources"
    }

  # azurerm_virtual_network.example will be created
  + resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
      + address_space       = [
          + "10.0.0.0/16",
        ]
      + dns_servers         = (known after apply)
      + guid                = (known after apply)
      + id                  = (known after apply)
      + location            = "westeurope"
      + name                = "example-network"
      + resource_group_name = "example-resources"
      + subnet              = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
